# Loan Status Prediction

### About
This is a Mini-Project for CZ1115 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on Loan Status from Kaggle's [Loan Status Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/loan-status-prediction).

### Problem Definition
1. Identify the most significant variable that affects loan status
2. Create a model that will help to assess whether a loan will be approve
3. Create a model that can suggest a loan amount to increase the likelihood of getting approval

### Contribution
1. @wteo026 - EDA, Decision Tree and RandomForest Regression for loan status prediction
2. @pigcansiwm - Decision Tree
3. 

### Model Used
1. Decision Tree 
2. RandomForest Regression
3. Cramers V
4. Point Biserial Correlation Coefficient

### Conclusion
1. Most variables in the dataset does not affect Loan Status
2. Most of our variables are catergorial variables (Y,N,0,1)
3. Credit_History is the most significant variable affecting Loan Status
4. Property Area might be a variable affecting Loan Status
5. Our model is able to predict Loan Status with an accuracy of 92%

### What did we learnt from this project?
1. Handling imbalanced datasets using resampling methods
2. Random Forest Regression
3. Cramer V
4. Point Biserial correlation
